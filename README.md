# LLM Apps with Langchain

In this two-week course you’ll master the Langchain library to build powerful LLM applications. 
- **Week 1** introduces Large Language Models and common integration challenges, guiding you through prompt design and a hands‑on Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot project.
- **Week 2** expands into agentic workflows with Langraph, teaching function calling, structured responses and a web‑research agent build.

This course equips you with practical expertise in tracing and monitoring LLM apps using Langsmith, crafting modular pipelines, and debugging complex workflows. You’ll learn to evaluate model outputs, iterate on design patterns, and deploy end‑to‑end solutions—skills that accelerate development, ensure reliability and position you to lead cutting‑edge GenAI projects.
