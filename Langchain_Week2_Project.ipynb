Once you have gathered enough information, you would then like to get a review of the document from your colleagues or supervisor to make sure that you're going in the right direction.\n","5. Finally, you would use the feedback you received to refine and iterate on your draft - making additional searches and research when necessary.\n","\n","In this project, we will translate this process into code with the help of Langraph - a library that is part of Langchain and allows us to define various flows of information.

Initially established as Healtheon, the company was rebranded to Healtheon/WebMD and later shortened to WebMD Corporation. The company is headquartered in Elmwood Park, New Jersey, and is primarily recognized for its consumer-focused healthcare information website, which has become the most popular source of health information in the United States.\\n\\nOne of the key figures in WebMD's transformation was CEO Jeff Long, who took over Healtheon in July 1997. Under his leadership, the company shifted its focus and formed strategic alliances with various organizations, including Medibuy.com, Humana, and pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly. These partnerships were aimed at expanding WebMD's reach and influence in the healthcare sector, allowing it to provide a wide range of transaction and technology solutions for healthcare providers and insurers.\\n\\nDespite its popularity, WebMD has faced criticism regarding the integrity of its content. A notable article in the New York Times Magazine raised concerns about the site's connections to pharmaceutical companies and other commercial interests, suggesting that this could lead to the dissemination of pseudomedicine and misinformation. Critics argue that WebMD's content is often framed to drive user traffic and ad sales rather than purely to inform. This has led to calls for users to be cautious when seeking medical information on the site.\\n\\nWebMD maintains that it adheres to strict editorial practices to ensure the independence and unbiased nature of its content. The company claims that its editorial staff operates separately from its advertising team, and that the information is produced by a team of medical professionals. However, there have been instances where the site has been criticized for not providing comprehensive information about the effectiveness of certain drugs or treatments, which raises questions about the depth and reliability of the information presented.\\n\\nIn summary, while WebMD has established itself as a leading source of health information online, its history is marked by strategic partnerships, commercial interests, and ongoing debates about the reliability and independence of its content. Users should be aware of these factors when utilizing the site for health-related inquiries.\",\n"," 'review_comments': \"The report provides a comprehensive overview of WebMD Corporation's history, partnerships, criticisms, and the challenges it faces regarding content integrity. However, there are several areas that could be improved for clarity, depth, and relevance to the task.\\n\\n1. **Task Alignment**: The report should explicitly state the task or problem it is addressing. It would be beneficial to clarify whether the focus is on WebMD's credibility, its business model, or its impact on healthcare information dissemination.\\n\\n2. **Depth of Analysis**: While the report mentions criticisms and partnerships, it could benefit from a deeper analysis of how these factors specifically affect user trust and the overall perception of WebMD in the healthcare landscape.\\n\\n3. **Current Context**: The report should include more recent developments or changes in WebMD's operations or policies, especially any updates post-2023 that may impact its credibility or business model.\\n\\n4. **User Guidance**: The conclusion suggests users should approach the site with caution, but it could provide more actionable advice on how to critically evaluate the information found on WebMD or alternative resources users might consider.\\n\\n5. **Citations and Sources**: The report references critiques and claims but does not provide specific citations or sources for these statements. Including references would enhance credibility and allow readers to explore the topics further.\\n\\n6. **Formatting and Structure**: The report could benefit from clearer headings or sections to improve readability and organization, making it easier for the reader to follow the main points.\\n\\n**Concise Instructions for Improvement**:\\n- Clearly state the task or problem being addressed at the beginning.\\n- Provide a deeper analysis of the implications of partnerships and criticisms on user trust.\\n- Include recent developments or changes in WebMD's operations.\\n- Offer actionable advice for users on evaluating health information.\\n- Add citations or sources for claims made in the report.\\n- Improve formatting with headings for better organization.\",\n"," 'draft_number': 3,\n"," 'max_reviews': 2}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Step 3 - Adapting our agent\n","\n","Let's start playing around with our agent and give it some additional capabilities.

Here‚Äôs an insightful look into the hidden secrets and lesser-known aspects of WebMD's history and operations:\n\n### Founding and Evolution\n- **Origins**: WebMD was originally founded as Healtheon in 1996 by Jeff Arnold, who aimed to revolutionize the way healthcare information was accessed online. In 1999, Healtheon merged with WebMD, a company founded by Jim Clark, and the combined entity was briefly known as Healtheon/WebMD before being shortened to WebMD Corporation.\n- **Leadership Changes**: Jeff Arnold played a pivotal role in shaping the company‚Äôs direction, particularly after taking over as CEO. His vision was to create a comprehensive online health resource, which led to significant investments and partnerships.\n\n### Strategic Alliances\n- **Partnerships**: WebMD formed strategic alliances with various organizations, including Medibuy.com, Humana, and pharmaceutical companies like Eli Lilly. These partnerships were aimed at enhancing the platform's offerings and expanding its reach, but they also raised questions about the influence of commercial interests on the information provided.\n\n### Commercialization and Criticism\n- **Ad Revenue Model**: WebMD's business model heavily relies on advertising revenue, which has led to criticisms regarding the integrity of its health information. Critics, including a notable piece in the New York Times Magazine, have suggested that the site is permeated with \"pseudomedicine\" and \"subtle misinformation\" due to its connections with pharmaceutical companies and the need to drive user traffic for ad sales.\n- **User Trust Issues**: The commercialization of health information has led to recommendations from some experts advising users to block WebMD‚Äôs results from their searches. This highlights a growing concern about the reliability of health information sourced from platforms that prioritize advertising over unbiased medical advice.\n\n### Recent Developments\n- **Jeff Arnold's Comeback**: After his initial success with WebMD, Arnold has made a comeback with a new health site called Sharecare, which has garnered support from high-profile figures like Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Mehmet Oz. This venture aims to provide health advice while also incorporating advertising, reflecting a continuation of the commercial strategies that characterized WebMD.\n\n### Conclusion\nWebMD's journey from a pioneering health information platform to a commercialized entity reflects broader trends in the digital health landscape. While it has provided valuable resources to millions, the intertwining of health information with advertising and corporate interests raises important questions about the reliability and objectivity of the content. Users should approach the information on WebMD with a critical eye, considering the potential biases that may influence the health advice they receive."},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We ran the modified graph by simulating a human-in-the-loop interruption and manually passing in the new state values.
